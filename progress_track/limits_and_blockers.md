# Limits and Blockers

1) The greatest blocker faced was lack of experience in Ruby on Rails. As this is my first project in Ruby <br> on Rails (more my first time every seeing the language) it resulted in major slow-downs when trying to <br> perform even the simplest of tasks

2) Database design was crucial for this project and poor initial designs also resulted in loss of time and <br> progress

3) The Ruby syntax for handling queries is different from normal SQL and I opted to use loops instead that I <br> could understand better, however all of the loops used are not efficient. This limits the application to small amounts of data.
